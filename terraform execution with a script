FOr automated execution of a terraform script few things need to be understood first.
1. Terraform expects user input on each plan/apply so inorder to make it fully automated you wwill need to stop this user input with below flag
 -input=false
2. Terraform creates an lock file on each planning stage but then when we do it automatically we might get into situations where this doesnt go smooths o you can mute this as below
 -lock=false
3. Now as we move forward a tetrraform script may need some parameter/arguments to be passed on runtime so this can be done as below
 -var 'argument_name=value'
 
 ## Here's an example we can refere to ###
 Run.sh

#!/bin/bash

var=$1

terraform init -input=false
terraform plan -input=false -var 'instance=${var}' -lock=false
terraform apply -input=false -var 'instance=${var}' -auto-approve
